# AirBnB Amsterdam
For the course "Python for Machine Learning" by Uplimit, the Week 1 project is to learn and perform interesting calculations on the Airbnb Amsterdam data. 

## Project Overview
In this project, we are using NumPy to perform various calculations and visualizations on the Airbnb Amsterdam dataset. We worked with Google Colab to write and run our Python code and visualize the dataset using Streamlit.

## Data Visualization
We visualize the Airbnb dataset as an geographic visualization using Streamlit.
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Listing_id:** Ignored for visualization purposes.
- **Price:** Hovering over a blue/red dot displays the price in bold.
- **Latitude:** Used to plot the blue/red dot on the map.
- **Longitude:** Used to plot the blue/red dot on the map.
- **Meters from favorite point:** Hovering over a blue/red dot displays the number of meters from the blue point.
- **Color:** Dependent on the category it's assigned.

### Streamlit Visualization
We are using Streamlit to create and host our interactive visualization.

## Course material week 1 summary
- Data Science Basics:
  - Uses data to gain useful insights for decision-making.
  - Example: Google shows personalized ads based on user data.

- Introduction to NumPy:
  - A Python tool for handling large sets of numbers efficiently.
  - Faster and more powerful than basic Python lists.

- Why Use NumPy?:
  - Can handle complex, multi-dimensional arrays.
  - Speedy operations thanks to optimized memory use.

- Performance Advantages:
  - NumPy is much quicker for big data tasks compared to standard Python.
  - Example: Adding numbers to a large array is much faster in NumPy.

- Working with NumPy:
  - Easy to access and modify array elements using simple commands.
  - Can perform operations on arrays of different shapes seamlessly.
